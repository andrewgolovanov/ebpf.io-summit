### 1. Mission and Scope of the eBPF Foundation

a) The purpose of the eBPF Foundation (the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, budget and spend
funds in support of various open source, open data and/or open standards projects relating
to eBPF technologies, including infrastructure and support initiatives related thereto
(each project, a “Technical Project”). The governance of each Technical Project is as set
forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Project.

b) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. Except with respect to the operation
of the BSC (as defined below), the Directed Fund operates under the guidance of the
Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The Linux
Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt
status.

c) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have
working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively, “Committees”)
that may be established by either the Governing Board or the BSC (as defined below).

### 2. Membership

a) The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum, Silver and Associate Members (each, a
“Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All Members must be
current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed Fund as
a member. All participants in the Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and undertake the
obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended with the approval of
the LF. During the term of their membership, all members will comply with all such
policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the Directed Fund may adopt with notice to
members.

b) Platinum Members will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board
and any Committee except for the BSC or Committees established by the BSC.

c) Silver Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one representative to
the Governing Board for every five Silver Members, up to a maximum of three
representatives, provided that there will always be at least one Silver Member
representative, even if there are less than five Silver Members. The Governing Board
determines the election process.

d) The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate Members of The
Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for joining the
Directed Fund as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a membership
organization, Associate Membership in the Directed Fund does not confer any benefits or
rights to the members of the Associate Member.

e) Members will be entitled to:

- i) participate in Directed Fund general meetings, initiatives, events and any other
  activities; and
- ii) identify themselves as members of the eBPF Foundation supporting the eBPF
  Foundation community.

### 3. Governing Board

a) The Governing Board voting members will consist of:

- i) one representative appointed by each Platinum Member;
  and
- ii) the elected Silver Member representative or representatives.

b) Only one Member that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 6)
may appoint, or nominate for a membership class election, a representative on the
Governing Board. No single Member, company or set of Related Companies will be
entitled to: (i) appoint or nominate for Membership class election more than one
representative for the Governing Board, or (ii) have more than two representatives on the
Governing Board.

c) Conduct of Meetings

- i) Governing Board meetings will be limited to the Governing Board representatives,
  invited guests and LF staff.
- ii) Governing Board meetings follow the requirements for quorum and voting outlined in
  this Charter. The Governing Board may decide whether to allow named
  representatives (one per Member per Governing Board and per Committee) to attend
  as an alternate.
- iii) The Governing Board meetings will be private unless decided otherwise by the
  Governing Board. The Governing Board may invite guests to participate in
  consideration of specific Governing Board topics (but such guest may not participate
  in any vote on any matter before the Governing Board).

d) Officers

- i) The officers (“Officers”) of the Directed Fund as of the first meeting of the
  Governing Board will be a Chairperson (“Chair”) and a Treasurer. Additional Officer
  positions may be created by the Governing Board.
- ii) The Chair will preside over meetings of the Governing Board, manage any
  day-to-day operational decisions, and will submit minutes for Governing Board
  approval.
- iii) The Treasurer will assist in the preparation of budgets for Governing Board approval,
  monitor expenses against the budget and authorize expenditures approved in the
  budget.

e) The Governing Board will be responsible for overall management of the Directed Fund,
including:

- i) create Committees of the Governing Board;
- ii) approve a budget directing the use of funds raised by the Directed Fund from all
  sources of revenue;
- iii) nominate and elect Officers of the Directed Fund;
- iv) except for those matters that are the responsibility of the BSC, oversee all Directed
  Fund business matters and work with the LF on any legal matters that arise;

  LF approval);
- vi) approve procedures for the nomination and election of any representative of the
  Silver Members to the Governing Board and any Officer or other positions created
  by the Governing Board; and
- vii) vote on all decisions or matters coming before the Governing Board.

### 4. eBPF Steering Committee (“BSC”)

a) The role of the BSC is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the
Technical Projects. The BSC will be responsible for:

- i) coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an
  overall technical vision for the community;
- ii) making recommendations to the Governing Board of resource priorities for Technical
  Projects;
- iii) defining the minimal requirements of eBPF runtime projects and “eBPF Projects”;
- iv) communicating on behalf of the eBPF community;
- v) establishing and overseeing committees focused on driving the mission of the eBPF
  Foundation including eBPF community events;
- vi) creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes; and
- vii) such other matters related to the technical role of the BSC as may be communicated
  to the BSC by the Governing Board.

b) The voting members of the BSC consist of:

- i) Two representatives (the “Kernel Representatives”) from the group of eBPF Linux
  kernel maintainers (as specified in the maintainer file). The Kernel Representatives
  will not be employed by the same Company or by Related Companies.
- ii) One representative (each a “eBPF Runtime Representative”) for each additional
  open-source eBPF runtime implementation. Each eBPF Runtime Representative will
  be nominated and elected by the applicable oversight body of each eBPF runtime,
  with nominations and elections subject to approval by the BSC. Nominees need to be
  active contributors to the applicable eBPF runtime.
- iii) Up to two representatives (“Additional Project Representatives”) from additional
  open source projects that are important to the eBPF ecosystem, as determined by the
  BSC. Each Additional Project Representative need to be an active contributor to one
  of these additional projects. The Additional Project Representatives will not be
  employed by the same Company or by Related Companies. Each Additional Project
  Representative must be nominated and elected by the BSC.
- iv) Up to three representatives with maintainer status (“Maintainer Representatives”) of
  major eBPF Foundation projects as approved by the BSC. Maintainer Representatives
  are nominated and elected by the applicable oversight body of each major eBPF
  Foundation project, with nominations and elections subject to approval by the BSC.
  No more than one Maintainer Representative may be employed by any one company
  or group of Related Companies.

There can be at most two representatives on the BSC employed by the same company or by
Related Companies. While normally members will serve two-year terms, the BSC will set
initial term length so as to stagger elections.

c) One representative of any Member may observe meetings of the BSC. Any committers
from a BSC Project may observe meetings of the BSC. The BSC may change this at any
point in time, including: (a) opening meetings to a broader community; (b) holding closed
meetings; and (c) holding meetings open to the public.

d) The BSC may approve a project lifecycle policy that will address the incubation, archival
and other stages and requirements of Technical Projects.

e) The BSC representatives will elect a chair to preside over meetings, ensure minutes are
taken and drive the BSC agenda with input from the BSC representatives.

### 5. Voting

a) Quorum for Governing Board, BSC and other Committee meetings will require at least
sixty percent of the voting representatives. If advance notice of the meeting has been
given per normal means and timing, the Governing Board may continue to meet even if
quorum is not met, but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

b) Ideally decisions will be made based on consensus. If, however, any decision requires a
vote to move forward, the representatives of the Governing Board, BSC or Committee, as
applicable, will vote on a one vote per voting representative basis.

c) Except as provided in Section 13.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a
meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided
in Section 16.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a
meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.

d) In the event of a tied vote with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the
Governing Board, BSC or other Committee, the Chair (in the case of the Governing
Board or BSC) or a Committee member (in the case other Committees) may refer the
matter to the Governing Board or BSC in the case of a Committee or in the case of the
Governing Board or the BSC, the LF for assistance in reaching a decision.

### 6. Subsidiaries and Related Companies

a) Definitions:

- i) “Subsidiaries” means any entity in which a Member owns, directly or indirectly, more
  than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in
  question;
- ii) “Related Company” means any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member or
  which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each
  case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more
  than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in
  question; and
- iii) “Related Companies” are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.

b) Only the legal entity which has executed a Participation Agreement and its Subsidiaries
will be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such Membership; provided,
however, that such Member and its Subsidiaries will be treated together as a single Member.

c) If a Member is itself a foundation, association, consortium, open source project,
membership organization, user group or other entity that has members or sponsors, then
the rights and privileges granted to such Member will extend only to the
employee-representatives of such Member, and not to its members or sponsors, unless
otherwise approved by the Governing Board in a specific case.

d) Directed Fund Membership is non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except a
Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to a successor of
substantially all of its business or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided
that the transferee agrees to be bound by this Charter and the Bylaws and policies
required by LF membership.
